(* Problem 6.
   Implement a function 'concat' that when given a list of int myLists,
   appends them all together into a single myList.
   Examples:

   When given a list ls of type 'a myList, and a function f of

   Example:

(* Problem 8.
   Implement a function 'even_index', when given an int myList, output an int myList to record the position of even numbers.
   Note that the index starts from 1.
   Examples:
   even_index Nil = Nil
   even_index (Cons(2, Cons(4, Cons(6, Nil)))) = Cons (1, Cons (2, Cons (3, Nil)))
   even_index (Cons(1, Cons(2, Cons(3, Cons(4,  Nil))))) = Cons (2, Cons (4, Nil))

(* Problem 9.
   Implement a function 'vaild_par', when given a string myList which only contains "(" and ")",
   return Some true if the parenthesis myList is in a vaild format.
   Note that valid parentheses means all the parentheses are matched and
   the matched parentheses are in the correct orderâ€‹.
   i.e., every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis.
   i.e., an opening parenthesis should come before the closing parenthesis.
   return None if the myList is Nil and return Some false if the parenthesis myList isn't in a vaild format

   Examples:

   return Some true if the matrix is an identity matrix
   return None if the matrix is Nil
   return Some false if the matrix is not an identity matrix.
   Examples:
   i_matrix Nil = None

(* Problem 11.

   A list could be used as a dictionary that maps values to values. We will use lists
      of type (string * int) myList as dictionaries to map strings to ints. We can implement
      a 'find_key' function that when given a dictionary and a key (string type), outputs
      the value associated to the key (int type) tagged with Some if said key exists within
      the dictionary. If the searched for key does not exist in the dictionary, output None.
      Examples:
      find_key (Cons(("a", 1), Cons(("b", 2), Cons(("c", 3), Nil)))) "b" = Some 2
      find_key (Cons(("a", 1), Cons(("b", 2), Cons(("c", 3), Nil)))) "c" = Some 3
      find_key (Cons(("a", 1), Cons(("b", 2), Cons(("c", 3), Nil)))) "d" = None
      find_key (Cons(("a", 1), Cons(("b", 2), Cons(("c", 3), Cons(("b", 4), Nil))))) "b" = Some 2
      Notes:
      * If the myList contains duplicate key entries, output the value associated to the "leftmost"
        entry.*)
let find_key (dict : (string * int) myList) (key : string) : int option = 
   (fold_left (fun maybe pair -> match maybe with 
               | Some value -> Some value 
               | None -> match pair with 
                           | (ss, ii) -> match ss=key with
                           | true -> Some ii
                           | false -> None ) None dict);;

(* Problem 12.
   Implement a function 'to_freq', that when given a string myList, output a list of
    type (string * int) myList such that each string is associated with its frequency in
    the original input.
    Examples:
    to_freq (Cons("a", Cons("a", Cons("b", Cons("c", Cons("b", Cons("a", Nil))))))) =
    Cons (("a", 3), Cons (("c", 1), Cons (("b", 2), Nil)))

    to_freq (Cons("jack", Cons("Jack", Cons("JACK", Nil)))) =
    Cons (("JACK", 1), Cons (("jack", 1), Cons (("Jack", 1), Nil)))

    Notes:
    * You do not need to consider the order of entries in the output.
    * There should be no entries with repeated strings in your output.
      An output such as Cons(("a", 1), Cons(("a", 2), Nil)) is not accpeted.
    * Strings are case sensitive. "jack", "Jack" and "JACK" are considered different
      and their frequencies are counted independently.*)
let to_freq (ls : string myList) : (string * int) myList = failwith "TODO"

(* Problem 13.
   Implement a function 'win_chance',
   given 2 myLists ls1 and ls2, represent that two lists of cards which player1 and player2 hold,
   In this card game, play1 and play2 don't know each other's cards and randomly pick one card
   from their card myLists ls1 and ls2,
   the function 'win_chance' outputs the all possibilities that play1 can win in the form of
   a myList of tuples.
   Note that there could be upto 13 different kinds of cards in the ls1 and ls2 which are
   "Ace" = 1, "2" = 2, "3" = 3, "4" = 4, "5" = 5, "6" = 6, "7" = 7, "8" = 8, "9" = 9, "10" = 10,
   "Jack" = 11, "Queen" = 12, "King" = 13
   The rule to win the game: "Ace" > "King" > "Queen" > "Jack" > "10" > "9" > "8" > "7" > "6" > "5" >
   "4" > "3" > "2"
   Note that if two cards picked are equal, then it's a tie game.
   Examples:
     win_chance (Cons(1, Cons(1, Nil))) (Cons(2, Cons(11, Nil))) =
     Cons ((1, 2), Cons ((1, 11), Cons ((1, 2), Cons ((1, 11), Nil))))
     Explanation : we have four ways to random select card from ls1 and ls2 in total
     (1, 2) -> "Ace" > "2" -> player1 win,
     (1, 11) -> "Ace" > "Jack" -> player1 win,
     (1, 2) -> "Ace" > "2" -> player1 win,
     (1, 11) -> "Ace" > "Jack" -> player1 win

     win_chance (Cons(7, Cons(11, Cons(2, Nil)))) (Cons(1, Cons(9, Cons(7, Nil)))) =
     Cons ((11, 9), Cons ((11, 7), Nil))
     Explanation : we have 9 ways to random select card from ls1 and ls2 in total
     (7, 1) -> "7" < "Ace" -> player1 lose,
     (7, 9) -> "7" < "9" -> player1 lose,
     (7, 7) -> "7" = "7" -> tie game,
     (11, 1) -> "11" < "Ace" -> player1 lose,
     (11, 9) -> "11" > "9" -> player1 win,
     (11, 7) -> "11" > "7" -> player1 win,
     (2, 1) -> "2" < "Ace" -> player1 lose,
     (2, 9) -> "2" < "9" -> player1 lose,
     (2, 7) -> "2" < "7" -> player1 lose

     win_chance (Cons(6, Cons(13, Cons(1, Nil)))) (Cons(7, Nil)) = Cons ((13, 7), Cons ((1, 7), Nil))

     The lengths of ls1 and ls2 are guaranteed to be at least 1 *)

(* Problem 14.
